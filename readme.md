This is the home assignment to build a computer from scratch. The computer is built using the by the inspired [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) course. The course is divided into two parts: the first part is building a computer from the basic logic gates, and the second part is building a compiler for a simple programming language. This repository contains the both parts of the course.
